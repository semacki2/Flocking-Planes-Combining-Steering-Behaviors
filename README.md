# Flocking-Planes-Combining-Steering-Behaviors
A fun visualization of how 3 different steering behaviors can be combines to produce complex group movement. The 3 steering forces are alignment, separation, and cohesion. The magnitude of these steering forces is applied globally to all planes. You can manipulate the magnitude of these steering forces, as well the max speed, max force, and plane size, using the sliders below the canvas. Allignment is the steering force that says I want to travel in the same direction as my neighbors. Separation is the steering force that says I don't want to collide with my neighbors. Cohesion is the steering force that says I want to be near my neighbors. When you combine all 3, you get a complex group behavior that we recognize as flocking.
